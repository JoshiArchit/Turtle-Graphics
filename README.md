# Welcome 
As a gamer im fascinated with sprites and simple graphics.

Turtle seems stressful, but I believe if you are a visual learner its a great tool to learn and master python.

This repository is a collection of scripts that can help you learn python as a beginner by visualization using the turtle library.
